### 11.0.5.2
* Added support for Bronze Celebration Token currency

### 11.0.5.1
* Fixed error caused by recent World of Warcraft patch.

### 11.0.5.0
* Added functionality to allow for multiple icons. In other words, for the "boss"
  type world quests, it can show the skull icon surrounded by the silver dragon.
  (This update is purely cosmetic.)
* There is now a configuration setting labeled "Show 'NEW' text for recently found
  world quests".  It defaults to ON (checked), since that's how the addon has always
  worked.  But, if you prefer not to see the "NEW" text at the beginning of lines,
  you can toggle this setting.  This is likely more useful for those who are switching
  between expansions regularly and don't want to see everything listed as "NEW" every
  time the switch is made.

### 11.0.2.21
* Fixed bug with the quest icons

### 11.0.2.20
* The addon will now automatically change expansions if you zone into a zone
  associated with that expansion (including when you first enter the game).  This
  should make things easier for those playing alts or who are still completing 
  world quests in past expansions for achievements, etc.  If you dislike this feature,
  you can disable it in the settings -- look for "Auto switch expansions based on 
  current zone".
* The "Time Remaining" column will now give the remaining time in days/hours for 
  any quest with more than one day remaining, hours/minutes for any quest with more
  than one hour remaining, and just minutes for any quest with less than one hour
  remaining.  (The coloring logic has not changed.)
  
### 11.0.2.19
* Tom Tom is now an optional dependency (i.e., the Tom Tom addon is 
  no longer required.)
* TWW Epic PvP type world quests now have the pvp icon at the front
  of the row, similar to pet battles, etc.

### 11.0.2.18
* Added support for City of Threads World Quests

### 11.0.2.17
* Fixed bug:  https://github.com/Amadeus-/Broker_WorldQuests/issues/21

### 11.0.2.16
* Fixed a bug with the "attach list frame to world map" feature as described at
  https://github.com/Amadeus-/Broker_WorldQuests/issues/20

### 11.0.2.15
* When enabled in settings, the Tom Tom waypoints support feature will now "add"
  waypoints rather than just adding/removing a single waypoint.
* TWW Epic Boss type world quests now have the appropriate icon at the front
  of the row, similar to pet battles, etc.
* Fixed a bug that was introduced in version 11.0.2.13.
* Now that Bloody Tokens are also part of the TWW expansion, the filter settings
  for that currency has been moved next to "Honor".

### 11.0.2.14
* The locked "Special Assignment" (Capstone) world quests are now included. While
  locked, what's provided by the addon is primarily informational. Once unlocked, then
  it becomes like any other world quest. 
* Dragon Rider Racing type world quests now have the appropriate icon at the front
  of the row, similar to pet battles, etc.
* Updated settings options:
  * Added new option to filter out Dragon Rider Racing type world quests.  It's 
    under "Filter by type".
  * Moved the filter setting for "Bloody Tokens" to within the Dragon Isles section.
  * Added new checkbox option (at the bottom of the list) to enable/disable
    "Spew Debug Information".  This is intended for use by those working on the 
    addon and should be unchecked for most users unless requested by a developer.

### 11.0.2.13
* Added support for world quests that only provide information regarding
  an XP reward to the addon API. In other words, there are world quests that
  have a line of blue text when you inspect it, "Awards a one-time Warband
  reputation bonus", but the addon API provides no other information about it.
  So, long story short, for these particular quests, the broker window will only
  show how much XP it provides.
* Began the process of cleaning up the source to be easier to read, consolidate 
  local variables together, avoid using local variables that aren't needed, etc.
  There will be a lot of line changes, but this (and future similar changes) will
  not affect functionality unless it's described in this file.

### 11.0.2.12
* Added support for The Weaver, The General, and The Vizier currencies

  when you click on a WQ in the addon) by 35%.
