## [SL-2.3.4a](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.3.4a) (2021-06-21)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.3...SL-2.3.4a) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### HOTFIX

Version 2.3.4a includes a hotfix for popout windows (you could get it why right-clicking Midsummer Fire Festival).

### Highlights of this update

#### Screenshot option! ðŸ“¸

Enable "Collected Things Trigger a Screenshot" to trigger a Screenshot when collecting Things!

It's in the Features tab of Settings.

#### Do Not Auto-Refresh when changing settings âš™

If you like fiddling with your settings sometimes, enable this option (at the top of the main Settings tab) to only refresh your Collection manually (Shift+Click) or when using keybinds. We will add helful reminder to refresh on the mode string if you have this enabled (so your mode will look like "After Refresh: Completionist Psycho").

### Other notable fixes:

- Daily quests should now reset completion on daily reset (same for other repeatable quests)
- The Breadcrumb skip warning will now attempt to include the name of said breadcrumb (Quest 'CoolName' [1234] will prevent collection of Breadcrumb Quest 'PurpleName' [123])
- Tracking all trackable Things (dailies, treasures, etc) should work more reliably now
- Fixed wrong difficulty detection when reentering instanced content (going into Heroic BrF after being in Normal, etc)
- Collecting Heirlooms no longer causes refresh lag (have you bought them all?)
- We've updated our technology and now PvP things can have unobtainable tags (think PvP + "Removed from game" combinations, etc)
- PvP Classic vendors/etc fixes
- Added Vicious mounts from BfA to vendors as removed (next week you'll be able to buy them)
- Some Battle Pet quest fixes for account wide quests
- **DO NOT BUY** Interdimensional/Pocket Pet Portals, they will become obsolete next week!
- Pet Battles and Pet Journal categories are now combined in the Battle Pets category
- Selfie filters were moved into Toy Box
- Fixed some quests that got borked when syncing TBC-Classic ATT with Retail version. This is an ongoing process, so please report any shenanigans you see in The Burning Crusade content
- More fixes for Things that are cost of other Things
- "Drum Circle" achievement in Thunder Totem can be soloed now apparently
- Good luck completing Kyrian Feat of Strength "To the Moon"!
- More refinement to Legion class halls
- Various quest fixes
