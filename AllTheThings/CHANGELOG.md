### Promotions

Earn Lil' XT ðŸ¤– through Prime Gaming until May 25, 2023. More details [here](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23938292).


### Logic changes

- Added in-game support for adding/clearing the sounds that ATT uses, such that they can be adjusted using a separate sound pack addon or even simply a WeakAura, without requiring custom changes to local ATT addon files.
- Added a check to prevent the minilist from auto-loading maps that are 'larger' than Zone maps (i.e. Continent etc.) (manually re-opening the minilist in these maps will load the entire map if really desired).


### Logic fixes

- Removed (via 'caging') Pets now properly trigger their warning when applicable.
- Fixed First Aid Recipes that are now offered via Alchemy/Tailoring from being marked as 'removed'.
